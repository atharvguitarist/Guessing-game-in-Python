# Guessing game in Python
This Python script implements a simple "Guess the Number" game using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. In this game, the player needs to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

# 🚀 Features:

-> The player specifies the range of random numbers within which the secret number will be generated.
-> The player enters their guess into an entry field and clicks the "Guess" button to check if their guess matches the secret number.
-> Feedback is provided based on the player's guess (e.g., "Try a lower number" or "Go a little higher").
-> The player can start a new game at any time, resetting the range and clearing the guess history.
-> The output textbox displays feedback messages and the results of each guess.

# 🎮 How to Play:

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the desired range of random numbers into the "Range of Random Numbers" entry fields.
3. Enter your guess into the "Enter your guess" entry field and click the "Guess" button.
4. Receive feedback on your guess in the output textbox.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you correctly guess the secret number.
6. Click the "New Game" button to start a new game.
